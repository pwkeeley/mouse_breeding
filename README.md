A project to analyze four years of breeding data from my lab

## goals
1) to gain a familiarity with various platforms used fequently in data science/bioinformatics
2) to analyze how genetic background influences the reliablity of beeding schemes
3) to form a predictive model suggesting when to replace a breeder pair given the genotype of the mice
